Okay, here is a Product Requirements Document (PRD) tailored for an AI software developer to create the initial landing page for Lume Credit's limited-time offer.

Product Requirements Document: Lume Credit - Limited Time Offer Landing Page

1. Introduction

Product: Lume Credit - Limited Time Offer (LTO) Landing Page

Purpose: This document outlines the requirements for a simple web application (landing page) for Lume Credit. The primary goal of this initial page is not to provide credit-building services directly, but to capture contact information (primarily emails) from users interested in a specific, limited-time promotional offer.

Target Audience (Internal): AI Software Developer

Target Audience (End User): Individuals interested in improving their credit score who are potentially early adopters attracted by a high-value, one-time offer.

2. Goals

Primary Goal: Collect and securely store contact information (Name, Email) from interested users.

Target Metric: Achieve 250 unique user sign-ups through the landing page form.

Secondary Goal: Validate user interest in the Lume Credit concept and the specific lifetime offer.

Constraint: This offer is limited to the first 250 sign-ups. The mechanism for enforcing this limit (e.g., manual monitoring, simple counter) should be considered.

3. The Offer

Offer: Lifetime subscription to a future bundle of two Lume Credit credit line subscriptions.

Price: $200 (One-time payment).

Availability: Limited to the first 250 users who express interest via this landing page.

Note: Payment processing is out of scope for this initial landing page. Users are expressing interest now; payment collection will happen later.

4. Functional Requirements

FR1: Landing Page Display

The application must render a single web page accessible via a URL.

The page must clearly display the Lume Credit brand name/logo (Placeholder acceptable initially).

The page must prominently feature the details of the Limited Time Offer:

Headline highlighting the lifetime deal.

Description of the future bundled credit line subscriptions (briefly explain the value).

Clear statement of the $200 one-time price for lifetime access.

Emphasis on the limited availability (e.g., "Only 250 spots available!", "Exclusive early access").

The page must include a clear Call To Action (CTA), such as "Get Early Access" or "Reserve Your Spot".

FR2: Contact Information Form

The page must contain a form to collect user information.

Required Fields:

Full Name (Text input)

Email Address (Email input type)

Optional Fields: (Consider if needed, but keep it simple for higher conversion)

Phone Number (Tel input type) - Specify if required or optional. For now, assume optional.

The form must have basic client-side validation (e.g., check for non-empty required fields, valid email format).

The form must have server-side validation for the same fields.

FR3: Data Submission & Storage

Upon clicking the submit button associated with the form:

The collected data (Name, Email, optional Phone) must be securely transmitted to the backend.

The backend must store this information reliably (e.g., in a database). Data must be easily exportable or accessible for future use.

FR4: Post-Submission Confirmation

After successful form submission, the user must be shown a confirmation message on the page (e.g., "Thank you for your interest! We'll contact you soon with details on how to secure your lifetime deal.")

The form should be cleared or hidden after successful submission to prevent duplicate entries from the same session.

FR5: Email Confirmation (Optional but Recommended)

Upon successful form submission, send an automated confirmation email to the user's provided email address using the Resend.com service.

Email content: Confirm their interest, briefly reiterate the offer, and state that further instructions (including payment) will follow.

Requires integration with Resend.com API (API key management needed).

FR6: Sign-up Counter (Optional - Nice to Have)

Display a counter indicating how many spots out of 250 have been claimed or are remaining. This can be a simple display updated periodically or upon page load. Requires logic to fetch the current count from the database.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: Usability: Simple, clean interface. Easy to understand the offer and fill out the form.

NFR2: Performance: The landing page should load quickly (< 3 seconds).

NFR3: Security:

Use HTTPS.

Protect against basic form spam (e.g., honeypot field, simple CAPTCHA - specify if needed).

Ensure secure storage of collected personal data.

NFR4: Responsiveness: The page must render correctly and be usable on common desktop and mobile browser sizes.

NFR5: Reliability: The form submission process must be reliable. Data capture should not fail under normal load.

NFR6: Maintainability: Code should be clean and well-organized for potential future expansion (though this specific page might be temporary).

6. Data Management

Data Collected: Full Name (String), Email Address (String, Validated Format), Phone Number (String, Optional).

Storage: A simple, secure database is sufficient. Structure needs to allow easy retrieval/export of the collected list.

Data Usage: Collected data will be used to contact interested users about finalizing the $200 lifetime subscription purchase and for future marketing communications related to Lume Credit. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA if applicable - though for 250 users, complexity might be low initially, basic privacy notice recommended).

7. Integrations

Resend.com: Required for sending transactional confirmation emails (if FR5 is implemented) and potentially for future bulk email campaigns to the collected list. Secure handling of the Resend API key is necessary.

8. Design & UX Considerations

Focus on clarity, trust, and urgency.

Minimalist design to keep focus on the offer and the form.

Use a placeholder logo/branding if final assets are not ready.

Ensure clear visual hierarchy: Headline -> Offer Details -> CTA -> Form.

9. Out of Scope for this PRD

User accounts/login system.

Payment processing integration.

The actual credit-building features or subscriptions.

Admin dashboard for managing users (manual database check/export is sufficient for this phase).

Complex analytics integration (basic page view tracking is okay if desired).

A/B Testing functionality.

Automated enforcement of the 250 user limit (manual monitoring/disabling the form is acceptable).

10. Success Metrics

Number of successful form submissions (Target: 250).

Conversion Rate (Submissions / Unique Visitors) - if basic analytics are implemented.

Bounce Rate.

11. Open Questions

Final copy for headlines, descriptions, and CTAs? (Use sensible defaults for now).

Specific branding guidelines or assets (logo)? (Use placeholders).

Is a phone number required or optional? (Assumed optional).

Is a simple spam protection mechanism (e.g., CAPTCHA) required? (Recommended).

How will the 250 limit be tracked and enforced? (Assume manual stop initially unless counter (FR6) is implemented).

Prompt for AI Software Developer:

"Please develop a simple web application based on the requirements outlined in the PRD above for the 'Lume Credit - Limited Time Offer Landing Page'.

Key Objectives:

Create a single-page responsive web application.

Display information about a limited-time offer ($200 lifetime deal for 250 users).

Implement a form to collect Full Name and Email (Phone optional).

Securely store the submitted data in a backend database.

Display a success message upon form submission.

(Optional but preferred) Integrate with Resend.com (using provided API key) to send a basic confirmation email upon successful submission.

(Optional Nice-to-have) Implement a simple counter display for remaining spots.

Constraints:

Focus solely on the requirements specified. Features listed as 'Out of Scope' should not be built.

The choice of specific programming languages, frameworks, or databases (the tech stack) is flexible, but prioritize simplicity, security, and rapid deployment for this specific landing page goal.

Ensure data storage is secure and easily accessible/exportable for later use.

Provide placeholder content where final text/assets are not specified.

Please outline the proposed architecture (Frontend, Backend, Database) and confirm your understanding of the core requirements before proceeding with code generation."
