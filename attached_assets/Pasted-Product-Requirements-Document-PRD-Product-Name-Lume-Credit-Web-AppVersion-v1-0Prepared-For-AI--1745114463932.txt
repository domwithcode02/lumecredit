üîç Overview

Lume Credit is a credit-building fintech platform designed to provide powerful financial tools for underserved communities, students, immigrants, and second-chance credit users. This PRD outlines the requirements for the initial launch of a web-based application that features a limited access offer for early adopters: the first 250 customers only.

After the 250th user signs up, the application will automatically lock out new registrations. Upon successful signup, users will receive automated transactional and welcome emails sent via resend.com.

The landing page must be fun, vibrant, and straightforward ‚Äî reflecting LumeCredit's youthful brand (i.e. "Credit Bro") while still delivering professional clarity.
