This sounds like a classic authentication loop issue. Based on your description, the login authentication might be working, but the redirect logic is causing a loop back to the login page. Here's a prompt you can give your AI software developer to fix this issue:

---

"I'm having an issue with my React/Vite application where after successfully logging in, the page just refreshes and stays on the login page instead of redirecting to the landing/dashboard page. The authentication seems to work, but there's a redirection loop. Please fix the redirection logic in my authentication flow to ensure that after successful login, the user is properly redirected to the dashboard/landing page and doesn't get stuck in a login loop. My project uses wouter for routing and JWT for authentication."

The most likely causes of this issue are:

1. The token is being stored but the authentication check is failing
2. The redirect is happening but another route guard is sending the user back to login
3. The login success response isn't being properly processed

Here's a quick solution you could implement yourself:

1. Add a console log in your login function to check if the token is being stored correctly:

```javascript
// After login success
console.log("Token stored:", localStorage.getItem('token'));
```

2. Modify your authentication check to include debugging:

```javascript
const isAuthenticated = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  console.log("Authentication check, token exists:", !!token);
  return !!token;
};
```

3. Force the navigation using a direct location change instead of the router:

```javascript
// In your login success handler
if (response.ok) {
  const data = await response.json();
  localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);
  console.log("Login successful, redirecting...");
  
  // Try a more direct approach to navigation
  window.location.href = '/dashboard';
  
  // If that doesn't work, you can try:
  // setTimeout(() => setLocation('/dashboard'), 100);
}
```

4. Check if there are any route guards in your app component that might be intercepting the authenticated user and redirecting back to login.

This issue often comes down to timing or conflicting redirect logic, so focusing on those areas should resolve your login loop problem.
