                <AccordionContent className="text-slate-600">
                  Tradelines are credit accounts that appear on your credit report. They include information about 
                  your payment history, account balance, credit limit, and more. Having diverse tradelines (like revolving 
                  and installment accounts) with positive payment history can significantly improve your credit score by 
                  demonstrating responsible credit management across different types of accounts.

                  While results vary by individual, our customers typically see a 40-70 point improvement in their 
                  credit scores within the first 60-90 days. Factors that affect improvement include your current credit 
                  history, existing tradelines, and overall credit profile. Our TotalBoost+ bundle is designed to maximize 
                  your potential improvement by addressing multiple scoring factors simultaneously.

                  FlexCredit is our revolving tradeline, similar to a credit card, which improves your credit utilization 
                  ratio and revolving account history. SteadyBuild is our installment tradeline, similar to a fixed loan, 
                  which diversifies your credit mix and demonstrates your ability to manage different types of credit. 
                  Together, they provide a balanced approach to credit building.

                  HomeTrack reports your on-time rent payments to all three credit bureaus, which can help establish

                  fee plus a monthly verification fee. We work with your landlord or property manager to verify payments, 
                  or you can submit proof of payment directly through our platform.
